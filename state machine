#State 1: Wait for a hard tap. When tapped, a random LED will turn white. Then, the second LED will turn Red and darken the previous LED. If LED#2 turns red, change to second state
#State 2: Make LED#0 Blink 3 times in blue. Move to State 3.
#State 3: If user touch pad A4, move on to State 4.
#State 4: Light up Neopixels 2,4,6 Green, Yellow and blue respectively
#State 5: Wait for user to touch A6 to start over.
